This is the git repository for software defined RFID reader for USRP2.
This work is based on usrp2reader by Yuanqing Zheng which in turn is based on Gen2 project by Michael Buettner.

Hardware:
	gen2_reader: USRP N210, USRP RFX900 daughterboard  

The aim of the project was to create a setup capable of reproducing the findings of Buettner. 
It turned out that the software needed a major cleanup to be useable/maintainable by others, and was also based on deprecated technology, which resulted in a complete rewrite.
Not much of the original gen2/usrp2reader project is left.

The file MasterThesis.pdf fully documents how to use the software, how it was created, and everything in between.
